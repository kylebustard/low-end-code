When I was 18 years old I attended a summer camp at Berklee College of Music in Boston, MA. I was coming off my first year of college. I’d received a warning of being placed on academic probation if my grades dropper further. I was a mechanical engineering major. My classmates at University of North Carolina–Charlotte wanted to pursue careers in motorsports and NASCAR, and that didn’t interest me much. In the spring and fall semesters I was enrolled in calculus, chemistry, physics, statistics, English, western civilization, and two other courses that were not in the engineering track for my degree: American military history, and jazz improvisation.





The American military history professor was Dr. James K. Hogue who earned his PhD from Prince University, and formerly taught at the US Military Academy at West Point. At the time I wanted to transfer to a service academy–the US Naval Academy to be precise. I thought that having the course on my transcript along with the engineering prerequisites (i.e., calc, chem, physics) would bolster my chances of being admitted to the the Naval Academy which is as selective as an Ivy League school. While a junior in high school I had decided to pursue the elite academy in Annapolis. I had an SAT score of 1230 or 1260–I’m not certain which it was, but I know it was higher than the minimum required score at the time and it was higher than then POTUS George W. Bush, himself an Ivy League alum and earner of a 1206 SAT score (although it’s not fair to compare, since we took our tests decades apart and scoring likely changed, high school was a long time ago, and he and I have both had life experiences and lots of growth since then. He’s now a painter and artist, and I now work in technology. We both live in the great state of Texas at the time of this writing). I had a family friend, the late Bob Owendoff, who was an academy graduate (class of ’68) and he took me on a trip to Annapolis and toured me around, introducing me to staff including the then-superintendent, Admiral Naughton, who was a classmate of his. Bob retired from teaching at the Academy, and he was a kind, generous person who spent his time looking after his airline captain wife’s two biotin frises Beau & Ollie, volunteering as an usher at our church, and helping guide me through the process of applying to Annapolis. He was a genius who corrected errors on sundial information he discovered in the Encyclopedia Britannica and created land navigation guides that were used by the Cub Scouts and Marine and Army pilots in Vietnam–it’s an important detail to his story that he was only 16 years old when he did this. He went on to graduate from the academy and serve as a naval surface warfare officer before teaching subjects like nuclear thermodynamics at the academy. If you visit the academy today, you can see his graduating class’s gift which is a sundial inspired by his work. I should find the photograph I took beside the sundial and upload the image in this post… Anyway, Admiral Naughton soon stepped down from his position at the Academy, and I learned that competition for a congressional appointment was fierce. My congressional liaison told me the competition in my district included kids who had all the boxes checked: Varsity letter athletes? Check. Perfect SAT score? Check. Class president? Check. I couldn’t ever compete with these kids who I assumed had always known they wanted to go to a service academy and spent their entire high school tenure campaigning for class president in the morning, practicing sports in the afternoon, and running drills for standardized testing in the evening. These ambitious teenagers also spent their weekends volunteering. I’d moved to a new state and enrolled in a private school my junior year of high school. I went out for football where I discovered that football is a great sport for breaking fingers (I missed half the season because I had pins surgically put into my finger) and I’ve got such a bad case of tendonitis in my ankles that I have vowed to never step foot into a pair of cleats again. I had trouble making friends the first year. The school assigned me a buddy who was the class Vice President, but he never followed up with me after our initial meeting. I made friends with some students who were seniors, and I was a mascot of sorts earning the nickname “adopted senior”.In hindsight, that wasn’t the best move since they’d be graduating and I’d have to start from scratch making new friends. Beginning my senior year, I campaigned for class Vice President. I knew it would be difficult to successfully run against the incumbent class president, so instead I made myself her running mate and vice-presidential candidate. I ran an inexpensive campaign which included doodling “Vote for Kyle–VP” notes and circulating them in classes. I was the only student campaigning for Vice President but I still lost to the incumbent Vice President. He was a cool guy, but I bet no one remembers he was Vice President but me. The high school was privately run by a Southern Baptist church which was once one of the largest churches in Charlotte, NC. It was an adjustment for me, because they didn’t assign homework on Wednesdays, just the other nights. The idea was to free students up to attend Wednesday evening Bible study at the church. However, my church had Bible study not on Wednesday but on Tuesday and I volunteered at my church and played bass guitar in the worship band–a time consuming commitment where I would need to practice songs during the week and arrive early before a worship service for rehearsal and soundcheck. It was a challenge that my study habits had not grown to match. Despite that, I made good grades in most subjects except for subjects that didn’t interest me at the time like chemistry.
